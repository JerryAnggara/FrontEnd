CSS is employed to enhance the visual aesthetics, ensuring that the application is both visually appealing and consistent with modern design standards. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality, allowing for seamless user experiences and real-time data processing. Bootstrap, a powerful front-end framework, ensures the application is responsive and mobile-friendly, offering a cohesive and adaptable layout across various devices and screen sizes. Together, these technologies create a polished and efficient front-end experience that effectively engages users.
